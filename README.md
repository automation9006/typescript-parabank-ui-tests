They are in need of some automated tests for APIs and their front end. Your task requires you to set up
the initial framework and a single test for APIs and UI.

Minimum Requirements
● Playwright Framework
● A readme to get the tests running
● Scripts to run tests in the package.json
● A directory structure that's scalable
● Code re-usability

Task
Set up the repo with the above in and write the code that executes the following tests

● UI:
○ Given I visit Parabank
○ When I try to login with an random username and password
○ Then I should get the error: “The username and password could not be verified"

● API:
○ Given I call a random cocktail 3 times
○ When I store the cocktail name in an array
○ Then my array should have 3 cocktails names

Resources
● Cocktail GET endpoint
○ https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php#:~:text=Lookup%20a%20random%20cocktail

● Parabank front end link
○ https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm


Things to think about/Bonus Points:
● Fixtures
● Directory structure
● Storing elements
● Scaling the repo
● Reporting

```shell
git clone  <git url>
``````

### run tests from scripts block with below command line

-- command to run regression tests
`npm run test:regression`
-- command to run specific test on qa environment
`npm run test:qa`
-- command to run sanity tests on uat environment
`npm run test:uat`
-- command to run sanity tests on stg environment
`npm run test:stg`
-- command to run sanity tests on prod environment
`npm run test:prod`
-- command to run tests by tags
`npm run tags:sanity`
-- command to run tests chrome
`npm run test:chrome`
-- command to run tests firefox
`npm run test:chrome`
-- command to run tests webkit
`npm run test:chrome`
-- command to generate report
`npm run allureGenReport`
-- command to publish report
`npm run allurePublishReport`

### Run a single test file
```shell
ENV=qa npx playwright test homePageValidations.spec.ts
```

### **Run tests in Headed mode**
```shell
ENV=qa npx playwright test homePageValidations.spec.ts --headed
```

### **Run the test in a specific Project (Browser)**
```shell
ENV=qa npx playwright test homePageValidations.spec.ts --project=firefox
```

### **Run the test with the Title**
```shell
ENV=qa npx playwright test -g "Your Test Title"
```

### **Disable Parallel Execution**
```shell
ENV=qa npx playwright test --workers=1
```

## Debug the Playwright Test
To debug the tests, open the terminal and type the following commands -

### **Debug all the tests**
```shell
ENV=qa npx playwright test --debug
```

### **Debug a single test file**
```shell
ENV=qa npx playwright test homePageValidations.spec.ts --debug
```

## run tests headed with specific browser
```shell

ENV=qa npx playwright test homePageValidations.spec.ts --project=chrome --workers=1

add other browser values under project like firefox,edge 
```

## run tests by tags
```shell
ENV=qa npx playwright test tests/login.spec.ts --project=chrome --grep @sanity
```

## To generate allure reports,please run the below command if you do not see the dev dependencies.

npm i -D @playwright/test allure-playwright
npm install -D allure-commandline

## Run this command and this will generate allure reports:

npx allure generate allure-results --clean
